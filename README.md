# Pomodoro timer
This is a pomodoro timer app for pc.

## Getting started
To start using the app download the zip and decompress it. Then run the .exe file. You will see two buttons. To get started working, press "Start". This will enable a window that will ask you to introduce the timings for work and breaks. If you don't set them, you will get the default, traditional timings (25-5-20). Then, each time you complete a work set, you will see a checkmark. If you want to start over again, or reset the timing configuration, just click the button "Reset". Also, each work session will get registred in the pomodorolog.DAT file, with the duration and also the date and time you worked. This file will be created the first time you use the app, and will keep updating itself each time you accomplish another work session. This file will be created in the folder you unziped for using the app.

## What's Pomodoro?
Pomodoro is a methodology for having the best performance while doing a task. This originally sets a focus time of 25 minutes, then 5 rest minutes. This cycle is repeated three times, and in the forth time the rest duration is 20 minutes. And it keeps going.

## About the app
This app was programmed with Python 3, using two packages: turtle and Tkinter. Tkinter helps developing a user interface, while turtle was used for user interaction. For the compilation I used PyInstaller. For further releases I'm expecting to change some of its functionality, in terms of data storage, to make a more structured database using pandas and csv.
